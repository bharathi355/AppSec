1. Overview of NIST

The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) is a U.S. government agency responsible for developing standards, guidelines, and frameworks for cybersecurity, risk management, and cryptography.

Key publications include:

NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) v2.0 – Risk-based approach to security

NIST Special Publications (SP) – Guidance on various security topics

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) – Cryptographic standards

2. NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) v2.0

The NIST CSF provides a structured approach to managing cybersecurity risks. It consists of:

Core Functions:

Identify – Asset management, business environment, governance

Protect – Access control, awareness training, data security

Detect – Anomalies and event detection, continuous monitoring

Respond – Incident response, communication, analysis

Recover – Recovery planning, improvements, communications

Tiers:

Tier 1: Partial (informal processes)

Tier 2: Risk Informed (policy-driven, inconsistent execution)

Tier 3: Repeatable (formal risk management)

Tier 4: Adaptive (real-time risk adaptation)

Profiles:

Customization based on organizational risk and objectives

3. NIST Special Publications (SP) for Application Security

NIST SP 800-53: Security and Privacy Controls

Defines security controls for federal systems, categorized into:

Access Control (AC)

Audit and Accountability (AU)

Configuration Management (CM)

System and Communications Protection (SC)

Tailoring guidance for Application Security (AppSec):

Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)

Supply chain risk management

Secure coding and testing requirements

NIST SP 800-218: Secure Software Development Framework (SSDF)

Establishes secure development practices:

Define security requirements early

Implement security controls in code

Verify software security before deployment

Respond to vulnerabilities post-release

Aligns with DevSecOps and CI/CD best practices

NIST SP 800-190: Container Security Guide

Security guidance for Docker, Kubernetes, and containerized applications:

Image scanning and signing

Least privilege container execution

Secure orchestration and runtime monitoring

4. NIST Guidelines for Cryptography & Compliance

Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS)

FIPS 140-3 – Cryptographic module security validation

FIPS 197 – AES (Advanced Encryption Standard)

FIPS 186-5 – Digital Signature Standard (DSS)

NIST SP 800-175B: Cryptographic Applications

Key management, encryption policies, and compliance

Zero Trust & Modern Security

NIST SP 800-207 defines Zero Trust Architecture:

Continuous authentication and least privilege

Microsegmentation for data and access control

5. Practical Application in Lead AppSec Role

Implementing NIST Guidelines in an Organization

Secure SDLC: Integrate NIST SSDF into Agile/DevSecOps workflows

Risk Assessment: Use NIST CSF to evaluate security posture

Compliance: Ensure FIPS/NIST standards compliance for regulatory needs

Automation & Tooling: Integrate security tools aligned with NIST controls

Incident Response: Adopt NIST SP 800-61 (Incident Handling) guidelines

6. Key Takeaways

Demonstrate deep understanding of NIST CSF, SP 800-53, and SSDF

Relate NIST principles to real-world AppSec challenges

Show experience in mapping NIST controls to cloud, CI/CD, and Zero Trust

Discuss tools (SAST, DAST, SBOM, IAM) and how they align with NIST

Explain how to drive compliance & risk management with NIST standards
